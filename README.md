This code is my first project for the class CS 135 : Software Analysis And Design
It is an Arithmetic Game that allows the user to ask another user multiple questions dealing with numbers and their operation, as you go from one task to the next
it builds up upon the previously created code and it all comes together to be able to make one full functioning game that tests the users knowledge on basic arithmetic questions
and returns a grade letter and their percentage score
